# First-TensorFlow-Neural-Net

This is my first neural network I created using TensorFlow. It can correctly label images of English letters! 
I am using the dataset called notMNIST, which consists of images of a letter from A to J in different fonts.

In order to run the code blocks in Jupyter Notebook and see the neural net in action you will need to first setup a Conda environment. 
I have provided the environment file so you can easily install all the necessary packages.
